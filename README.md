## 🧩 Overview  

**MindNode for macOS** is a beautifully designed mind mapping and brainstorming app that helps you visualize your ideas in a structured, meaningful way. It transforms loose thoughts, notes, and inspirations into organized diagrams that make connections clear and creativity effortless.  

Built around a simple drag-and-drop interface, **MindNode** allows users to map out concepts, tasks, and plans using color-coded branches, icons, and tags. Each node can include notes, links, images, or to-do items, making it perfect for everything from project planning to personal journaling.  

MindNode’s **Focus Mode** and **Outline View** let you seamlessly switch between high-level overviews and detailed planning. Its **Quick Entry** feature captures thoughts as they come — even before you open the main app. Cloud synchronization keeps all your mind maps accessible and updated across your Mac, iPhone, and iPad.  

With native **Apple Silicon optimization**, MindNode offers an ultra-smooth experience and near-instant rendering of even complex maps. Whether you’re brainstorming, managing knowledge, or planning a major project, **MindNode** brings visual clarity to your ideas like never before.
